# Chris Dunleavy - Game Store Finder
----
This app displays a map of the bay area with markers corresponding to local game stores. A list of those stores that appear on the map is displayed on the side of the screen, along with a text field into which the user can type characters to filter out stores that don't match. Clicking on a store's marker or list entry will open up an info window on that marker containing the store's name and the top tip from Foursquare, if available.

This project uses knockout.js, jQuery, Google Maps API, and Foursquare's API.
